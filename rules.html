                    to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator,
                    administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action
                    regardless of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

                        <span>DIMENSIONS.</span> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a
                        given maximum and
                        minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
                        under 12 and older.

                        unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                        Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
                        the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                        leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                        required to play all their games away.
